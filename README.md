**0% Cloud. 0% Spying. 100% Ownership.**

Remember-Me is a military-grade, offline "Second Brain" that lives entirely on your hard drive. It combines local LLM inference (Llama-3/Qwen) with our proprietary **Quantum Dream Memory Architecture (QDMA)** to create an AI that helps you think, remembers everything, and answers to **no one but you.**

> "Don't rent your cognition. If the API goes down, you become stupid. If the model changes, you become confused. Own the stack."

## 🔥 THE MANIFESTO

The current AI landscape is broken.

* **They steal your data** to train better models to sell back to you.
* **They censor your thoughts** to align with corporate safety guidelines.
* **They hallucinate** because RAG is just "grep for embeddings."

**Remember-Me is the kinetic response.** It is an Open-Source, offline-first architecture that prioritizes **Agency** over convenience.

## 🧠 THE ARCHITECTURE (How It Works)

This is not a wrapper. This is an Operating System.

### 1. The Engine (Local Inference)

Built on the battle-tested `llama.cpp` server.

* **No API Keys.** No OpenAI bill. No network requests.
* **Hardware Agnostic.** Runs on CPU (fast) or GPU (blazing).
* **Model:** Pre-configured for **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B** (2026 SOTA) or **Qwen-2.5-Coder**.
* **Engine:** `llama-server` (High Performance).

### 2. The Brain (QDMA - Quantum Dream Memory)

A hierarchical memory projection engine that outperforms standard Vector DBs.

* **Hot Memory:** Immediate context (RAM).
* **Cold Memory:** Compressed "Dream States" (Disk).
* **Feature:** It "sleeps" to compress redundant vectors, preventing the context window from bloating while retaining infinite recall.

### 3. Framework 50 (Deep Research Agent)

**The Scientist.**

* Autonomous Research Agent capable of web traversal and synthesis.
* **Zero Drift:** All logic is constrained by the CSNP Merkle Chain.
* **Output:** Comprehensive research papers, not just summaries.

### 4. The Shield (CSNP - Merkle Verification)

**The Hallucination Killer.**

* Every memory saved to the ledger is Hashed into a Merkle Tree.
* When the AI retrieves a fact, it **must** provide the cryptographic proof that the memory exists in the chain.
* **Result:** If the AI tries to make something up, the math says "False," and the output is blocked.

## 🚀 INSTALLATION (30 Seconds)

We built this for everyone. You do not need to be a Python wizard.

**Prerequisites:** Windows 10/11 (Linux support coming soon). 8GB RAM.

1. **Clone the Repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/merchantmoh-debug/Remember-Me-AI.git
    cd Remember-Me-AI
    ```

2. **Install the Brain (Zero Config):**

    ```bash
    python install_brain.py
    ```

    * *Automatically detects hardware and downloads DeepSeek-R1 (4.9 GB).*
    * *Verifies integrity via SHA-256.*

3. **Ignite the System:**
    Double-click **`start_sovereign.bat`**.
    * *Launches the backend engine.*
    * *Opens the "Cognitive Interface" in your browser.*

## 🖥️ THE INTERFACE

**The Streamlit Dashboard ("Cognitive Matrix")**

* **Chat Matrix:** A Cyberpunk-styled terminal for deep work.
* **Visualizers:**
  * **Integrity Meter:** Real-time Merkle Chain status.
  * **Entropy Gauge:** Measures how "chaotic" the memory vector space is becoming.
* **Commands:**
  * `/imagine` - Generative conceptualization.
  * `/search` - (Simulated) Web retrieval.
  * `/save` - Force a flush of RAM to Disk (Snapshot).
